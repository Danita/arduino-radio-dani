#Arduino multi radio panel

This is a simple multi radio built on an Arduino Mega board, and it's loosely based on [this idea](http://www.jimspage.co.nz/Multi_Radio.htm). The project requires the [Ardsim library](http://svglobe.com/ardsim/index.html). In the `Radio_Dani/assets` folder you'll find the schematic and the label illustration.

You can see a [demo here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlGcpu_0X9g).
